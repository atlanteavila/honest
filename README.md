# Honest

> Losing valuable objects suck! Be it your purse, wallet, dog, or perhaps even a loved one. Honest gives you and your community the opportunity to be a good Samaritan. Post a picture and info on the lost item/person. The people in your community and beyond have the chance to find it and return it.
