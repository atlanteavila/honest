There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## HONEST ##

 - Anyone interested in building a better, more honest society.

## Summary ##
  > Losing valuable objects suck! Be it your purse, wallet, dog, or perhaps even a loved one. Honest gives you and your community the opportunity to be a good Samaritan. Post a picture and info on the lost item/person. Your people in your community and beyond have the chance to find it and return it.

## Problem ##
  > posting on craigslist is a gamble. The person you're meeting could be dangerous. This helps keep you a little safer when trying to recover items you lost.

## Solution ##
  > We seperate lost items into categories. A user posts a descriptive list of the qualities of the lost item and a picture of the item. If someone finds the item they post it to the found section and all users of that category with matching characteristics are notified. If they believe it is theirs they message the finder and set up a meeting in a safe public space. The case is then closed. For pets and people the user post is made public to all on the front page that the user can scroll through.
